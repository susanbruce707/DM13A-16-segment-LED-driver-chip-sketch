# DM13A-16-segment-LED-driver-chip-sketch
Arduino UNO sketch to drive the DM13A 16 segment LED 24 pin DIL driver chip.
A very basic Arduino sketch to light up each of the segments on a common anode 16 segment LED display digit.
I found that the current limiting resistor I used (220 R was too low) and needs to be 4.7 k
The chip survived, but the LED display was overdriven and loss a couple of segments.
It was lovely and bright for a time, more amber than green, Ha ha :-)
(Always read the data sheet carefully)
Thanks for watching and God Bless You.
